--------------

The Avatarix-application is a simple GUI that fetches profile pictures from the Github
website and displays them. In our case, the application shows the profile pictures of
all students of IMA14 in the SWENGB course, sorted by groups. The pictures function
as buttons. When clicking on one of the pictures, further information of the selected
student will be provided.
At the right side, there is also a scroll-bar for navigation.

No installation needed.
